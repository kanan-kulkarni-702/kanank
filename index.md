# Introduction:
Filemanager is a cloud based file management utility using a standard Web browser. Files uploaded to cloud are tracked for changes (version management). Users can self register and upload file, make changes and update file/s. Since it is cloud based it can be accessed from any corner of the world.
During registration, the user can set up his/her password with an email id. Thereafter users can access it from any location.
